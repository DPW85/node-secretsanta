# Memo from Santa

## About

This is a quick hack.

My girlfriend needed a way to organise a Secret Santa party, so I built it for her.

This has been a great way to learn the basics of AngularJS and build an application on the (M)EAN stack. Things can probably improved in major ways. However, since I wanted to put this online and we're already december 6th at the time of writing this, a lot of dirty hacks made it into the codebase.

## To do / to learn

A lot of these could have been done if I did not have such a strict deadline. I had to hack things together quickly because I really wanted this to be working in the first week of December (and even that was a little too late).

- Clean up
- Learn to write tests properly and adopt a test-driven workflow. Too much time has been wasted on testing various parts of the application manually.
- Learn to structure server-side code properly and adopt an async mindset.
- Update to Angular 1.2 and dig deep into the framework. Figure out where to put non-Angular helper methods, learn about filters.
