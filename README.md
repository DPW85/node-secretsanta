# Memo from Santa

## About

This is a quick hack.

My girlfriend needed a way to organise a Secret Santa party, so I built it for her.

This has been a great way to learn the basics of AngularJS and build an application on the (M)EAN stack. Things can probably improved in major ways. However, since I wanted to put this online and we're already december 6th at the time of writing this, a lot of dirty hacks made it into the codebase.
